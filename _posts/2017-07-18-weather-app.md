description: I wanted to create a web app for comparing the weather in two different locations. It uses react components for all the buttons and the symmetrical layout. In addition to integrating with the weather channel for weather information, I had to use google geocode to take the zip-code and get the city name and the latitude and longitude coordinates that the weather api required. <a href="https://patomation.github.io/demos/weather-app">PROJECT DEMO</a>
