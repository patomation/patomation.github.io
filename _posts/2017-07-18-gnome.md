description: I was inspired by the <a href="http://imgur.com/404">imgur 404</a> page that has paintings who's eyes follow your mouse. So I took it apon myself to see what it takes to create such a thing. Using a combination of css and javascript I was able to create a gnome who's eyes will follow your mouse. <a href="https://patomation.github.io/demos/gnome">PROJECT DEMO</a>
