description: I was wondering what it would take to make a vintage computer that could scale based on the browser size and would go full screen for smaller devices. Well this is it. Take a moment to resize your browser window while viewing this demo. You will notice the responsive ness. Additionally the text content on the screen scrolls independently of the page using a css trick.<a href="https://patomation.github.io/demos/vintage-computer">PROJECT DEMO</a>
