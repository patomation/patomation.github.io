       <h1>Fine Karunamit</h1>
       <p>
         Born in Thailand, Fine grew up surrounded by nature. She knew that she wanted to help people and make them happy for a living. So, following in her family’s footsteps, she became an RN in a rural hospital near the Myanmar border, then worked in an international Hospital in Bangkok. After experiencing the pros and cons of a successful nursing career for 8 years, Fine was looking for a new direction, but she still wanted to make people happy and feel good about themselves.
         <br />
         <br />
         Always interested in fashion, she thought that she would try her hand at it. At age 29 Fine decided to move to America to study Fashion Design. Her inspiration came from her memories of being surrounded by nature, and the edgy upcoming styles of city life.
         <br />
         <br />
         Constantly working hard, reaching for her goal to become a designer, Fine met many people with unique skills that would help her grow her vision. Now using those skills, she captures the beauty and intricate details of nature to bring her fashion to life.
