## Project Ideas

2. Pitchfork.io - a Crowd mob app.
Bringing people together.
A fake app thats like 4square or yelp that organizes people into mobs iwht pitchforks and torches to attack a business or something. Could be fun for a fake app design or even mockup prototype.


1. Tape Cluster Drum Machine:
Use a bunch of the tape objects to load a bunch of loops that are all the same length. Clicking on the tape plays that part of the song in a loop.
Of course each tape is animated. Because I'm awesome...

Maybe add colors for each tape. Using svg colors or something...

So a bunch of tapes are stacked up 4x4
each tape can be clicked and it starts playing a loop. PArts of song ie the hat loop, kick loop, Snare loop pattern, perhaps a synth pattern... Just make a bunch of loops in an audio editor and export the layers so the loops are all the same bpm and length..

Future. Add a time feature? Volume ect?

Just take react components:
- cassette tape
- PLayer
and put a bunch of them up all with different audios.
