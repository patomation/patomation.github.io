## What did I do?
Researched webcams.travel api
Time-Zone-Video-Clock idea Put together a plan for a timezone clock where I gather web cams from all of the timezones and put them all on one page. So the user can watch the sun rise and set across the globe from the grounds perspective. I saw it as an art installation somewhere but cant find the link. I wondered how the artist did it. I thought it would be cool to build one of these things.
Put together a template for blog journaling from a cool video I watched that was supposed to be about some software called screver.

Not really sure how to impliment viewing webcams from different sources without having to make custom players for each source.
