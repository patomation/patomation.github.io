## What lesson did I learn?
I learned the basics of express
I learned a file structure to keep express api working easier
- Freedom from merge conflicts in entry point
- using glob to combine all files in dbb schema and routs
  - This is nice because I don't have to reference any new files in the main file...
I learned about mongodb
Learned about SEO and marketing

## What could I have done better?
I could have learned how to add users to the database while learning about the express server.
Figured out automated unit tests for express-server project.
Figure out how to get https ssl cert to work on netlify with custom domain...
I should have writen more stuff down as I went.

## What did I write?
I think I probably only wrote documentation for the stuff I was learning about.

## How did I market my content?
I did not market so far.
But I did look into reddit marketing and seo backlink stuff....

[BLOCKING] Whats blocking me is having a perminent url for my site. This blocks me from marketing but I would like to have a solid brand before going forward with marketing....

## What did I do?
Researched webcams.travel api
Time-Zone-Video-Clock idea Put together a plan for a timezone clock where I gather web cams from all of the timezones and put them all on one page. So the user can watch the sun rise and set across the globe from the grounds perspective. I saw it as an art installation somewhere but cant find the link. I wondered how the artist did it. I thought it would be cool to build one of these things.
Put together a template for blog journaling from a cool video I watched that was supposed to be about some software called screver.

## What lesson did I learn?
Collecting webcam info is tedious.
Not really sure how to impliment viewing webcams from different sources without having to make custom players for each source.
React Forms
I learned that building forms in react sucks if you use outdated technology. Like react-validation.
I eventually figured out that all the cool kids are using Formik. Then I rewrote my code a third or forth time. Funny how tou dont notice big problems untill you get well into the middle of building something. Especially when its bitg.

## What could I have done better?
I could resaerch "best technologies" to do x. Next time. And start by learning a well documented frame work and build around that. Instead of trying to do my own thing and coding what i think is cool stuff only to have to throw it away because it doesnt fit with the framwork.
I guessI had to build the thing to know what I needed. But If its forms I'm always going to use FORMIK for react.

Most everything else I can make by hand. The funny thing was that formik handles a bunch of the things I was trying to manually code oof.
I waisted 3-4 days.


## What did I write?
Wrote in blogging journal


## How did I market my content?
Ugg, SEO backlinks are a mistery

## What website changes did I make?
I worked on a form for Lanna.

## What should I focus on this week?
Learn about back links - automate adding thousands of backlinks. <-- mvp?

Lanna mentioned that my old site had better content. I looked at it and I was using a theme. I might just steal some ideas from the old theme and use them in my custom theme. I might bring in some of my old projects...
- SEO learning - backlink building for lanna Site Priovateguideinchiangmai.com
- how to turn off react auto complete - anoying
- Improve website by..
  - Stying header - animations?
  - Bring in some old projects. Or rebuild them.
    - IDEA: make a plugin that lets people add googley eys to a photo?
  - Talk aboiut projects more on portfolio. Provide some code examples..
- Trying out the API server and Database for the tour booking app..

## How often did I rise early to write?
A couple of times i got up at 8ish and started to write code. Does that count?
