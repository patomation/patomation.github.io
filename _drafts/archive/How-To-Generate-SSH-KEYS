Some Commands:

Generate ssh key
```ssh-keygen```
Use defaults

View ssh key that was made
```ls ~/.ssh```

```eval ssh-agent```

Add generated key to ssh keychain?
```ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa```

Copy ssh key to paist in github or bitbucket
```pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub```


Notes and considerations:
Do we need to make a sepparate key for git and bitbucket or can we use the same key?
