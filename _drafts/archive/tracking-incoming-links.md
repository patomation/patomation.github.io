# Tracking incoming links

Something I've thought about doing that Ive seen others do is track incoming links.
Just to see how effective my marketing really is.

So what I would like to discover is how to manage incoming links.
For example what If I have a link up on my linked in. I would have no way of knowing that somone clicked on it. Since I just put up patomation.github.io.

The old linked in link
```
https://patomation.github.io
```

I'd like to put a quary string that shows that it came from linked in. Like so:
```
https://patomation.github.io?utm_source=linkedin
```

So now lets dig into extrapolating this into sometihing we can use
MAybe a lugin for jekyll or something
