description: Using react components I built an animated Amsterdam bicycle. In this project there are reusable components such as a frame and wheels that accept parameters. I intended to make this project scalable so additional styles of bikes can be added with ease.  <a href="/demos/react-bicycle-animation">PROJECT DEMO</a>
