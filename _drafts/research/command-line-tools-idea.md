add scss class command
to quickly create new class files
usage
```
newclass my-class-name
or
class my-class-name
```
What it would do:
creates a file in the scss dir
```
src/sass/classes -react app
_sass/classes - jekyll builder
```
makes ```_my-class-name.scss```
that contains:
```css
.my-class-name{

}
```
Ready to go for me to add stuff.
This is so I can make a class file...
FOR EVERYTHING
And a shit load of them without having to painstakingly make them....

Bonus:
Ammends main.scss and adds import
``` sass
@import 'classes/my-class-name';
```

Then I can style like a mofo
