# Anoyances

The purpos of this is for me to log the things i find anoying in my process of developing ang doing things on the computer...

Windows Alt tab
- How when you switch programs the thumbnail view changes order each time you switch tabs by the last used program is first and the second and so on. So as you switch tabs the order is getting shuffled around and it takes longer to find what your looking for.
Especially when you have two or more of the same program open and you thought your were switching to this terminal only to be an a different one like the rug got pulled out from under you.
On mac. It just keeps the order. < why cant windows be like this...

Duplicating files without it adding copy. Just add 001 002
Im constantly dealeting " - copy from files"
Also why is control d delete? on windows. it should be duplicate...

F2 for renaming things. How about enter...
